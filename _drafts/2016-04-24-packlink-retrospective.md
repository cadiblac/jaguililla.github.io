Debriefing

These are some things I saw in me... and some things I saw in others. This is simply a bunch of cliches,
but you don't realize them until you see or do them.

I enjoyed beeing involved in the team creation, selection, and so on.

Tech (microservices)
* Commit to a platform (JVM, CLR). Don't aim to support everything as you would end up supporting nothing.
* Do not use the best tools, use the tools that best fit you. For me it is more important for example that
  you can integrate a tool in your tests, than a few milliseconds in runtime.
* Doing it simple is only for the brave... If you do it, well... it was easy, if you fail you are a damn
  fucking idiot... Be brave to do things easy. Everytime you see something you understand at first sight,
  think that someone though hard for it to be that way.
* Start small, grow fast. start with something that works and build upon it... Better done than perfect.
* Share code among components as libraries... but only for platform related things (transversal stuff)
* If you try to reuse too much you get coupling. Sometimes less is more.
* Something that is great for Google can harm you... know where you stand and who you are, you do
  not go to war with the army you want, but with the army you got. Plan for your army, do not pretend it to
  be other.
* You NEVER do enough automated tests
* Design so what you do is easy to understand for others.
* Tools are never valued enough... people see a waste of time in them, a lack of proper tools will slow down
  people outside IT and inside development, as there will be task that needs to be done by other people that
  have to be done by developers due to a lack of tools.
  Managers always see the time it will take to have proper tools, they never see the time saved to other
  departments and develpment itself.
* Documentation. I've got a mix of feelings about this... Do not document something that can be automated,
  do not think. Ie: the bootstraping of a project can be in the readme, or in a script
  The minimum? for me is the public API, the contract with the outside world (RPC, events, config parameters)
  and a readme How you do that is another question.

Business
* Investor's money is like items in Stephen King's "The shop"
* Legacy software should be splitted and rewritten (clean your house before moving out), not repackaged.

Workflow
* Conway law. It doesn't mean that you build micro services if your team is a complete chaos.
* Teams with boundaries develop software with boundaries. It has its drawbacks, but at the end of the day
  I prefer to be able to change components.
* Let people decide their fates, if you impose something on others... Do not force something thinking it will
  be best... Demochracy is based in the assumption that everyone is represented in the same scale they exist
  in society, not the majority rule the minorities.
* Hero mode development is for weaks, 
* Good software takes time at the beggining, bad software takes time at the end... Where you want to spend
  your time depends of the deadlines.
* Prefer Scrum over Kanban
* Tools matters... get good ones (JIRA, Slack, Google Docs, Gmail)
* The easiest the process the less mistakes you'll have, reduce manual operations and documentation, simplify
  states (usually plan, ready, working, review, test, rejected, done is enough)

Personal
* Trust what people do, but check if everything is alright
* Let people decide
* Listen more than talk
* Even if you think something is not important, just let everyone know
* I should have payed more attention to code reviews
* Believe in what you see, not what you ear
* Prefer people that code over people that read
* Do not give up if you believe in something
* Do not trust people that never make mistakes
* Do not trust people that laugh about other's work
* Read less, think/do more
* Check people motivations / goals... Some people want to learn things, others want to make money no matter
  what
* There are good teachers and bad teachers... A good teacher will explain complex things quietly and in an
  easy way and will assure you actually understood what he explained, a bad teacher will explain things fast,
  focusing on the details and probably will think you are dumb if you didn't undertood. Good teachers are
  extreamly hard to find.

You do not know how it would be until you try
