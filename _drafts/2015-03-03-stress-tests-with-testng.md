TODO

Progressive enhancement

Firt the test

Then integration tests

After that annotate to execute several times calling prior tests (separate tests, from stress tests)

Add warmup

Handle data to get times

The future:

Compose different integration tests in a single scenario and launch several instances

Extract information out of the data (store it in CSVs or DBs)

The pitfalls (times doesn't match) less threads better performance ???
