TODO

So... you tough that you would split your program in smaller different ones and you expected it
to work better from the start?

Me too, you can not see all things in the road until you start walking

Move the complexity from the architecture to the platform

Needs

* Documentation
* Logging
* Events
* Alarms
* Discovery
* Configuration
* Workflow
* Containers
* Teams
* Environments
* Tools
* Contracts between services (provide clients)
* Be more flexible with the arch of each component
* CI, quality (PRs with CI and static code analysis)
