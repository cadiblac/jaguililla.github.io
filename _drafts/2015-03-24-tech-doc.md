Doc rationale

* Don't doc if others already documented (pick the standard way of doing
  things). Ie: semver, gitflow
* Try to adapt to standard instead of changing
* Keep it small and focus on the important things forget about prose, bullet
  points and checklist are best
* Split docs in small, highly specialized documents (easier to maintain)
* Keep all together in a convenient place (in the code if it is possible)
* Prefer programming over documenting. Ie: develop script over sequence of
  steps (avoids errors)
* Formats (word processors are EVIL, avoid them for tech stuff). Use cloud
  services for diagrams
* Autogenerate all you can, Javadoc, reports
* Use links not things like... see the third paragraph of point 2 of style
  guide... make it easy for your reader... because... if no one read your doc...
  you are f**** wasting your time!
* If it is tech... keep it close to the code, make it easy for developers to
  keep it updated
