My blog rationale
- I think therefore I code
- Colors
- Rodin
- HAL 9000
- Vintage computers
- Contents

My blog (behind the scenes)

- jekyll new <user>.github.io
- atom.xml and _includes taken from 'UP'
- sitemap.txt and rss.xml taken from jekyllbootstrap.com
- templates from startbootstrap
- Why Jekyll instead Jekyll bootstrap? MVB (minimum viable blog)
- Install: ruby, gem, jekyll, python, pygments
- Selecting a theme (going with vanilla Jekyll + templates (startbootstrap) )
- Operation: using make (available from all Unix, in the end it has to be Unix... so who cares about multiplatform)
- Generating 'syntax' for pygments
- Using CDNs instead copying libraries
- Deployment (git commands)
- References (themes, info, jekyll)
- Using webstrap
- Redcarpet markdown parser didn't work for me I used the default one ?'kramdown'?
- crossdomain, humans & robots from HTML5 Bootstrap

Fork it at Github
Change /img/icon.png (see icons.sh)
Pick another style (or change one) (see styles.sh and themes.sh)
You can delete the CV... unless you want to pretend be me (which I strongly discourage)
Of course, fill the _drafts and _posts directories with your own content
_graphics is not really relevant, if you like the photos, keep them
Change CNAME, humans
